# Food App
A modern **food ordering Android application** built using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, focusing on clean UI, proper state management, and modern Android development practices.

---

## Overview
This project demonstrates how a real-world food ordering flow can be built using Jetpack Compose without XML. The focus is on **state-driven UI**, **asynchronous operations**, and **reusable composables**, rather than just making screens work.

The app showcases a simple but realistic user flow: browsing food items, displaying lists efficiently, and managing UI state correctly.

## Tech Stack
- **Kotlin**
- **Jetpack Compose**
- **Coroutines**
- **ConstraintLayout (Compose)**

---

## Concepts Implemented
- **Composable functions & Composition**
- **Recomposition and state-driven UI**
- **State management**
- **LazyColumn for efficient list rendering**
- **Coroutines for asynchronous work**
- **Basic MVVM-style separation**

---

## Project Focus
- Writing declarative UI using Jetpack Compose
- Understanding how recomposition works
- Managing UI state predictably
- Avoiding UI blocking with coroutines
- Building reusable and maintainable composables
